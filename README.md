About the project

## Inspiration

Have you ever got EXHAUSTED from LeetCode?
Have you ever felt extremely BORED when preparing for interviews?
Have you ever desired to have a companion so you won’t be “tortured” by coding ALONE?

According to our surveys sent, almost 75% of coders find solving LeetCode problems boring when they are coding alone, and more than half of the coders have strongly wished to have a companion while coding. Thus, we created codely -  a place for coders to compete and learn while having fun with other coders.

## What it does

Users could compete with online random coders or friends. While competing, users could interact with their opponents (emojis & chat). Coding problems are generated based on users’ rankings (we have a ranking system with five divisions). Similar to gaming platforms, users could climb the rank through matches. Apart from loving and care, we introduce competitiveness.  Apart from loving and care, we introduced competitiveness. 

## How we built it

We split the work and assigned them to our teammates (etc. each of us was in charge of specific web components, and some more experienced took over the layout and logistics work). And we coordinate via Github.

## Challenges we ran into

Quite frankly, we are new to React. But we spent a lot of time getting ourselves familiar with the new language, and walked each other through some tutorials, even prior to the event. Furthermore, due to covid and time zone issues, we worked remotely 100%. But we created our own discord channel and kept in touch with our teammates.

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of

We’ve achieved what we planned, and we did enjoy our work atmosphere. We are a lovely team, and our team members became close friends.

## What we learned

First time using React, our team learned how to build a web application with it. And more importantly, we honed our communication and collaboration skills. 

## What’s next for Codely

We are planning to add backend development to our application in the near future. We want to introduce a log in/sign up system, LeetCode scraper, and other applications based on our database.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
